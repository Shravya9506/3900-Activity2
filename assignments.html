                    To test the skills acquired by the students, a number of activities, assignments, projects and quizzes will be conducted. Each of these assignments will be awarded points and based on cumulative of the points obtained, grades will be decided. Each assignment will be awarded points based on a rubric which will be made available in canvas once course starts. The nature of this class is that you learn how difficult it is
                    to complete software development (or other types of projects) within scope, on budget, and on time! so all the assignment should be submitted by the due date. Late assignments will therefore receive a penalty of 20% per day. No assignment will be accepted more than 3 days after the due date.
